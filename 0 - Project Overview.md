# Project Overview

Brief: investigate the decline in the patronage of Perth's public transport, with a particular focus on the Armadale line. By analysing changes to the demographics of the surrounding suburbs, the proximity of services and the notable shifts in the Perth landscape, we hope to identify the main factors that have contributed to this change.

Section Breakdown

Identifying the Problem:

1. Changing Local Demographics

What: by looking at current and historical data we hope to identify changes to the demographics of the suburbs along the trainline and whether this may have impacted on the patronage. Will ideally include comparison to other lines around Perth. 

How:  use ABS data to identify changes in important demographic factors like population size, income, age, # of vehicles. Note census data is only up to 2016, so may be inconsistencies across data.

Visualisation: Use heatmaps to illustrate population density and other factors of those living around trainlines in Perth.

2. Proximity to Services

What: identify whether the development of new services in the suburbs along the Armadale line have effected the need for those in the area to be using the service

How: important to establish why people use the service (work, education, retail, hospital etc), proximity of population to train stations along the route. 

Visualisation: show change over time through google map overlays may be tricky to map historical changes to all services, so maybe just focus on larger things like hospitals, schools, shopping centres.  

Sources:
- Googe Maps API
- State Government data for services like schools, hospitals etc


3. External Factors to Perth Life

What: what external factors be it policy, technological or infrastructural have effected peoples need/desire to use PT in Perth e.g ride sharing, Optus Stadium, freeway expansion, new trainlines/bus routes, cost of service, crime, mining boom

How: there won't necessarily be relevant data available for the effect of these types of factors, so might have to extrapolate using data from other regions. 

Visualisation: time series showing how factors may have influenced PT patronage over time. 

Sources: 
- Uber data?
- freeway usage through state government/ABS data

1. Introducing the problem/question (include context e.g graph of declining PT numbers in Perth)
2. Outline how group approached tackling answering the question. Elaborate on process of sourcing/cleaning data
3. Changing local demographics
4. Proximity to services
5. External factors
6. Summary findings and discuss issues that arose, things we didn't get time to touch on.
