Title: What is derailing the Armadale Line?

Brief: investigate the decline in the patronage of Perth's public transport, with a particular focus on the Armadale line. By analysing changes to the demographics of the surrounding suburbs, the proximity of services and the notable shifts in the Perth landscape, we hope to identify the main factors that have contributed to this change.
