1 - Show decline of Perth Public Transport in Perth

How:
Use Public Transport CSV, grab more general data from Perth population evolution
-Do graphs to visualise the decline or stadyness of the lines over the years. 
-Show population growth in Perth metro area, demonstrate that this is not aligned with the stediness of overall BUS and TRAIN (maybe a graph to vizualise)


2 - Demonstrate why we narrow down to points of interest such as the Armadale Line
-Compare the 5 train lines visually and compare the evolution between them. Discuss why some may have more aggravated declines and jump to the 3 main hypotesis
